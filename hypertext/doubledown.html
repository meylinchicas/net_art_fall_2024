  <p>After showing your crush the screenshots, you notice their eyes fill with tears. <br> "Y'know I was the one Mads was starting to talk to..." They sniffle as they avert their gaze.</p>
  <a href="possible.html">You wrap your arm around their shoulders, comforting them. <br> "Oh... I know this feeling sucks. God, I really hate seeing you like this. It makes me wanna beat Mads up."</a>
  <br>

  <a href="silentache3.html">You rub their upper back. <br> "Oh... well I'm sorry you had to find out this way. What're you gonna do now?"</a>
