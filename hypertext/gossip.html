  <p>"Mads and Mika? What about them?" They look at you with slight concern, but mainly curiosity.</p>
  <a href="badmads.html">"I heard that apparently they were in the middle of a talking stage when Mika suddenly blocked Mads. People think it's because Mads started talking to someone else IN THE MIDDLE OF TALKING TO MIKA. Can you believe that?"</a>
