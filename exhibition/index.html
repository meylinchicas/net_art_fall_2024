    <h1>⊹₊⟡⋆ LA SHE CIBERNETICA ༊·˚ </h1>
    <h3>♡ ✧₊⁺ Curated by Meylin Chicas ♡ ✧₊⁺</h2>
    <p>This collection showcases pieces that demonstrate the many facets of what it means to exist in the world as the She. The She is an identity aligned with femininity and/or womanhood. It is fluid in its expression, as is art, and these pieces utilize the net as their medium to express such a concept. From innocent guides to becoming an American Idol, a nostalgic dream of many young girls in the early 2000s and late 2010s, to an interactive story commenting on the effects of war, girlhood is expressed in many different contexts under complex circumstances. There is no set way to be the She. This curation of net art pieces paint a picture of womanhood by peering into LA SHE CIBERNETICA ⋆˙⟡.</p>

<img src="cyberfeminist manifesto.jpg">
  <p>This collection of works by VNS Matrix (Josephine Starrs, Julieanne Pierce, Francesca da Rimini, and Virginia Barratt) is an expression of femininity in a typically male-associated domain, the cyberspace. This embodies the concept of LA SHE CIBERNETICA ⋆˙⟡. as it directly translates being the She in the physical world to being the She in cyberspace. The self is political, and this piece demonstrates how mere existence in a different identity is a constant challenge of oppression.  </p>

  <p>American Idol was a reality TV show that took the world by storm in the early 2000s, selling the idea that anyone with talent could become famous if discovered and supported by the right people. Marisa Olson's blog showcases the fun, innocent elements of femininity. An expression of interest in something often written off as outlandish (usually due to its appeal to female audiences). This guide feels as if an older sister made it. It has an underlying feminine energy to it, forever preserved in a y2k craze. </p>

  <p>This particular piece is a YouTube video of a girl sitting idly while some clip art pieces appear around her. Petra Cortright directly challenged the preconceived concept of what a camgirl was by being void of anything sexual. Often, innocent parts of woman/girlhood are sexualized and tainted by male desire and perception. As part of the She, takes back camgirl culture as just a girl with a webcam. This artist also extended her statement into her behavior as she was combative with commentors. </p>

  <p>Olia Lialina styled this piece as an interactive hypertext narrative. This accumulation of hyperlinks tell the story of a couple reunited after war and the affect it had on their relationship. This is a facet of girlhood a lot, but not all, women understand firsthand. The woman in this narrative is not the perfect partner, which is another standard expected to be upheld by the She. The She is a complex identity that could never be defined by rigid conventionalities and her ability (or lack thereof) to meet them. The She has the same capacity to be just as stupid, selfish, unfaithful, and unfeminine as her counterparts. This is beautifully showcased in this work. </p>
