<h2>The Prince of Petals</h2>
<body>
<p>In a room shrouded in darkness lay a single body in a black open coffin of delicate blue hydrangea, cradling six white rain lilies against his chest: the nameless prince who lost his wings.<br>
    Suddenly he awakens, laying in a turquoise velvet arm chair. Unsure of where he is, he looks around the vivid bluish green room. Adorning the walls are beautifully detailed gold picture frames. The pictures encased in them were blank, as if something had been erased, gone entirely.</p>
<p>"It's not that I believe it..." sings a faint voice.</p>
<p>The prince looked around for the source of the familiar voice in hopes that it can tell him the answer to the question he still has yet to ask.</p>
<p>"But that I want to try holding out; because that is all I can do."</p>
<p>Stepping away from the chair he awakened from, the prince takes a step toward the voice.</p>
<p>"I want to remain, I want to dream more..."</p>
<p>Words so familiar to the prince, yet so foreign. He felt as if he had heard them before.</p>
<p>"Even so, what I'm saying is...that it's time to leave."</p>
<p>As the prince takes more steps towards the voice, he looks around as his hands trail over the nearby furniture. The picture frames were flashing with changing images, all of which were incomplete.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's my truth..." The voice sings.</p>
<p>The prince, still questioning where it's coming from, can't seem to find his own to ask.</p>
<p>"It's my truth... I will be covered with wounds all over; <strong>but it's my fate.</strong>" it solemnly sang.</p>
<p>The prince happened upon a long, oval-shaped mirror, confined in thorns. He sees no reflection, as if he were a mere phantom.</p>
<p>Moving past the room he arose, the prince wandered upon a corridor. The corridor decorated with thorns that grew ever so thicker led to an open rounded door. The prince followed the voice through it and found himself in a wilted garden.</p>
<p>A garden that hosted beautiful hydrangea full of color, rosey azaleas, and delicate peonies, was now a colorless, dry wasteland with nothing alive but thorns. Turning his head letward, upon a pedestal in the distance, the prince could see seven rain lily stems.</p>
<p>"Maybe I... I can never fly;"</p>
<p>The prince instinctively looked away from the pedestal and towards the voice, the breeze guiding him like an old friend.</p>
<p>"I can't fly like the flower petals over there..."</p>
<p>The wind gradually blew harder, eagerly pulling him towards the pedestal displaying six petals dancing upon its breezy rhythm,&nbsp;flowing towards a rusty, thorned gate.</p>
<p>"Or as though I have wings. Maybe I can't touch the sky."</p>
<p>He could feel his bare feet against the hard, calloused brick floor of the garden, as he chased after the flower petals. He found himself stopped at the thorned gate. Reaching out his hand, he pricked his pale finger upon the thorns. Recoiling his hand, the prince saw the dulled pink bricks below him begin to stain red from his blood.</p>
<p>"Still, I want to stretch my hand out..."</p>
<p>The wind kept carrying the petals father away from the prince's view. In desperation, he grasped the gate again; blood ran down his forearms, staining his robe.</p>
<p>"I want to run, just a bit more."</p>
<p>Clenching his fists until they turned white, the prince was able to open the gate doors and continue pursuing the petals.</p>
<p>"I'm just walking and walking, among this darkness. My happy times asked me this question: 'You, are you really okay?' It asked me, oh no."</p>
<p>As the prince trailed behind the petals, hurriedly walking along the dark grass with nothing but the moonlight illuminating the scenery, he listened to the voice, unaware of the trail of blood he ws leaving behind him and of what followed behind it.</p>
<p>"I replied, 'No, <strong>I'm so afraid</strong>.'"</p>
<p>The prince could hear the faint sound of waves crashing against rocks, the smell of salt slowly creeping into his nose and the sight of a cliff in the distance. He still followed the voice and petals, finding a strange comfort in the feeling of the grass below his suddenly aching feet.</p>
<p>"Maybe I, I can never fly. I can't fly like the flower petals over there, or as though I have wings..." The voice chanted again.</p>
<p>Feeling a sudden piercing sensation in his feet, the prince looked to the dimly lit ground to see the garden thorns engulfing his feet.</p>
<p>"Maybe I, I can't touch the sky..."</p>
<p>Unsure of what to do, the prince just ran, reaching for the pure white petals barely escaping his grasp.</p>
<p>"Still, I want to stretch my hand out; I want to run, just a bit more."</p>
<p>As the thorns creeped towards the prince's mid-calf, he felt as if he was suddenly awakened from a trance. On the brink of collapsing to his knees, tears welled up in his eyes, just a barely contained behind his waterline.</p>
<p>"Wide awake, wide awake, wide awake, no lie." The voice cried</p>
<p>Finding the strength to stand up, the prince chased after the petals at a faster pace than in the sleepwalk-like trance he was in just a few moments ago. He ran and ran until he was right at the edge of the cliff overlooking the dark ocean. Below him, the crashing waves of the midnight black water appeared to taunt him in their painless movements.</p>
<p>"Maybe I, I can never fly..." The voice sand in a quieter melody.</p>
<p>The thorns were slowly creeping higher the prince's legs, subduing him to his knees at the tip of the cliff. As he fell, then prince felt a sharp sting in the right side of his back. Painfully shifting his aching body, he knelt, facing the moon. He looked on as the flower petals danced with the wind into the pitch black sky, flowing against the twinking stars.</p>
<p>I can't fly like the flower petals over there..."</p>
<p>The prince longingly stared at the petals as tears streamed down his flushed cheeks. Suddenly, he found himself hurriedly disrobing himself.</p>
<p>"Or as though I have wings."</p>
<p>With his robe hanging off his waist, the prince stretched his large white wings to the sky. The moonlight beautifully reflecting off every silverish white feather. The prince felt the slightest sense of hope. He crawled a little further up the hill to hang his face and peer below to the roaring ocean directly below him. </p>
<p>"Maybe I, I can't touch the sky..."</p>
<p>The prince looked to the moon where the petals had vanished into. He was alone with nothing but the stars and crashing waves to greet him.</p>
<p>"Still, <strong>I want to stretch my hand out,</strong>"</p>
<p>Closing his eyes, the prince flung himself off the cliff, even as the stinging sensation ran up his spine. It was too late when the prince opened his eyes and realized the sudden sting he felt as he collapsed for the final time was due to one of his wings being broken.</p>
<p>Now as he fell, the thorns spread across his wings. He closed his eyes one last time, entering a sleep like death as tears finally stopped streaming down his face. The prince focused his hearing on the voice as it sang one last time.</p>
<p>"I want to run just a bit more." it finished.</p>

<h2>The King of the Clouds</h2>
<hr>
<p>The prince's eyes burst open as he found himself in a coffin of blue hydrangea. Rising sunlight poured through the stained glass windows, illuminating the vivid bluish green walls and beautifully detailed gold picture frames. The prince heard the voice sing again.</p>
<p>"I wanted to live my life for you, but as I keep doing that I just can't bear the storm inside my heart."</p>
<p>The prince felt like he knew who or what that voice was singing about, but couldn't picture a certain person. Sitting up in his flower bed, he felt the smooth stems of seven rain lillies upon his fingers. The image of the pedestal with seven stems flashed in his mind.</p>
<p>"The real me inside the smiling masl, I reveal it entirely." the voice sang warmly.</p>
<p>Now standing beside his coffin, the prince witnessed as the growing sunlight illuminated the picture frames. As soon as the light touched the blank images, they were restored to portray the prince himself.</p>
<p>"<em>I'm the one I should love in this world.</em>"</p>
<p>The prince could see himelf for the first time, smiling and laughing with familiar people he'd never mey before. The picture frames appeared to reflect his own lost memories.</p>
<p>"Shining me, precious soul of mine... I finally realized, so I love me."</p>
<p>The prince studied his features as he walked down the corridor. He saw his shining black hair that fell besides eyebrows and forehead, beautifully framing his face. He studied his almond shaped eyes the color of rich coffee, his radiant smile, and his colorful robes embroidered with rain lillies and peonies of lace.</p>
<p><strong><em>"I'm the one I should love."</em></strong></p>
<p>With new found hope, the prince continued on the familiar path.</p>
<p>"I'm shaking and afraid but I keep going forward."</p>
<p>He reached the oval-shaped mirror. Thorns no longer coiled around its perimeter, it reflected the beautiful image of the prince back to himself, solidifying he was real and not a phantom of someone he'd never have had a chance to know.</p>
<p>"I'm meeting the real you, hidden in the storm."</p>
<p>The thorns were gone from the beautifully detailed walls extending from the rounded door. The prince confidently walked towards the garden. In blissful awe, the prince admired the hydrangea popping in bright colors, the rosey azalea standing proudly upon the other flowers, and as the peones swayed in the light breeze.</p>
<p>"Why did I want to hide my precious self like this? What was I so afraid of? Why did I hide my true self?"</p>
<p>As the wind blew harder, the prince smiled as he reunited with the white flower petals. He gleefully chased them out of the gardens to the shining open grassland.</p>
<p><strong><em>"I'm the one I should love in this world. Shining me, precious soul of mine. I finally realized, so I love me."</em></strong> the voice chanted.</p>
<p>Suddenly the clouds eclipsed and hid the sun. The prince saw an unfamiliar swing up ahead. A man with black hair was sitting there, swinging to the wind's rhythm.</p>
<p>"I may be a bit blunt, I may lack some things..."</p>
<p>As the prince crept closer to the man, his heart beat excelerated to his growing anticipation. The familiar sound of the waves crashing against the rocks below the cliff graced his ears the closer he inched towards the stranger sat upon the gold swing. The prince stopped right behind the unknown yet familiar man.</p>
<p>"I may not have that shy glow around me..."</p>
<p>The stranger turned to face the prince. The prince's eyes widened as he found himself peering at his own smiling self.</p>
<p>"But this is me..." The man said.</p>
<p>The prince reached his hand out to touch him, but retarcted it as the source of the singing voice continued.</p>
<p>"My arms, my legs, my heart, my soul."</p>
<p>In a flash, the reflection was gone and the prince found himself at the edge of the cliff again. The sun came out of hiding, beautifully reflecting off the ocean's surface. Raising his robe, he saw the scars from where the thorns pricked him before. Turning away from the cliff, a path of red tiger lillies sprout from the trail of blood he left in the past.</p>
<p>"<stronger>I wanna love in this world.</stronger>" The prince sang, finally having found his voice.</p>
<p>"Shining me, precious soul of mine..."</p>
<p>Without a second thought, the prince fell backwards off the cliff. Hie eyes closed as he felt the warm sunlight on his face and the cool breeze overtake his body. This was the prince's peace.</p>
<p>"I finally realized, so I love me."</p>
<p>As he sang, his beautifully healed wings burst from his back, undisturbed by his loose robe. Feeling cold water at the tips of his toes, the prince opened his eyes to find himself hovering over the water below him. He witnessed as his strong wings fanned the water back as they flapped.</p>
<p>"Not so perfect, but so beautiful..."</p>
<p>He propelled himself up towards the sun, above the clouds where the chaos of the wind currents ceased. He just floated as his wings allowed him to. Closing his eyes and breathing in, the prince sang for the last time:</p>
<p>"<strong>I'm the one I should love.</strong>"</p>
<p>The singing stranger sat at the edge of the cliff, smiling as he gazed at the prince above the clouds.</p>
<p>"Long live the King of the Clouds." He whispered as he turned into a petal, reuniting with the other six and dancing away with the wind.</p>

<h4>Author's Note</h4>
<p>I wrote this short story my senior year of high school. It is based off two songs by BTS' Jin: <ul>Awake <br> Ephiphany</ul></p>
<p>The story is what I envisioned when I listened to the songs. I'm an imaginative person so I love to come up with stories.</p>
<p>The visuals were influenced by movies, specifically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN4I0PWj7OI">this scene from Maleficent 2014</a> and <a href="/Users/zuany/Desktop/Jin Awake.jpg">concept photos</a> for the album Awake is on.</p>
<p>I have plenty of other stories and visuals for other songs of all genres. These include but are not limited to: <ol>1. Prada by Arca <br> 2. Serendipity by Jimin <br> 3. LA Devotee by Panic! At the Disco <br> 4. Trade Mistakes by Panic! At the Disco <br> 5. Callaita by Bad Bunny <br> 6. Mojabi Ghost by Tainy and Bad Bunny <br> 7. In Your Eyes Remix by The Weeknd featuring Doja Cat <br> 8. Save Room For Us by Tinashe and MAKJ <br> 9. Solia by Bad Bunny <br> 10. Is This Love by Bob Marley and the Wailers</ol></p>
<p>I hope my high school work was not much of a chore to read. Thank you!⋆˙⟡♡ </p>
